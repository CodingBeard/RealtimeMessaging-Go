## Realtime Cloud Messaging Go SDK
Part of the [The Realtime® Framework](http://framework.realtime.co), Realtime Cloud Messaging (aka ORTC) is a secure, fast and highly scalable cloud-hosted Pub/Sub real-time message broker for web and mobile apps.

If your application has data that needs to be updated in the user’s interface as it changes (e.g. real-time stock quotes or ever changing social news feed) Realtime Cloud Messaging is the reliable, easy, unbelievably fast, “works everywhere” solution.
